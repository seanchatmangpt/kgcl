"""Archived tests - kept for reference but excluded from test runs.

These tests were archived during lean test refactoring (80/20 optimization).
The active test suite is now ~100 tests covering core functionality.

Archived directories:
- engine/: Atman, integration, nuclear simulation, knowledge engine demos
- hybrid/: Backward compat, hooks, lockchain, N3 parser, DMAIC, adversarial, etc.
- daemon/: Event store, service gateway, projection tests
- cli/: CLI command tests
- chaos/: Failure injection tests
- projection/: NextJS projection, sandbox, filters
- integration/: Testcontainer-based external service tests

To restore any test, move it from tests/archive/ back to tests/.
