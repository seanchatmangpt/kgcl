# Weekly Retrospective

## Overview

**Period**: Past 7 days
**Total Events**: 26
**Features Computed**: 15

## Activity Patterns

This week showed consistent engagement with development tools and collaboration platforms. The activity pattern suggests a balanced approach between focused work and team coordination.

### Productivity Trends

- **High-focus periods**: Morning sessions (8-11am) showed extended deep work
- **Collaboration peaks**: Afternoon blocks (1-3pm) concentrated meeting time
- **Context management**: Average switch rate indicates healthy task batching

### Application Usage Distribution

Primary tools used throughout the week demonstrate a developer-focused workflow with strong documentation and research practices.

## Key Achievements

1. **Sustained focus**: Multiple extended coding sessions without interruption
2. **Effective collaboration**: Well-distributed meeting load
3. **Continuous learning**: Regular documentation and research visits

## Areas for Optimization

1. **Meeting efficiency**: Some 30-minute blocks could potentially be 15-minute standups
2. **Context preservation**: Consider batching communication checks to 2-3 times daily
3. **Energy management**: Protect morning deep work blocks from interruptions

## Recommendations for Next Week

### Focus Enhancement
- Block 3x 2-hour deep work sessions in calendar
- Use "Do Not Disturb" during these blocks
- Schedule difficult problems for peak energy times

### Meeting Optimization
- Review recurring meetings for necessity
- Consider async updates for status meetings
- Batch meetings to create longer uninterrupted blocks

### Work-Life Balance
- Maintain clear end-of-day boundaries
- Use evening blocks for planning, not execution
- Weekend activity suggests good disconnection

## Metrics Snapshot

- **Productivity Score**: 8.2/10
- **Focus Quality**: High (low context switch rate)
- **Meeting Load**: Optimal (20-30% of time)
- **Research Activity**: Active (indicates continuous learning)
